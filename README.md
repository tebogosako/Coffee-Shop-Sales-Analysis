# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing coffee shop transactional sales data using **SQL** and **Google Cloud** technologies. The goal is to extract meaningful insights related to revenue trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product performance to support data-driven decision-making.

The project is designed as an end-to-end analytics workflow, from data ingestion and cleaning to querying, warehousing, and insight generation across multiple cloud platforms.


## Planning & Analysis Approach

Before implementation, **Miro** was used to plan the project workflow, define business questions, and explore analytical possibilities within the dataset. This helped structure the SQL analysis, identify key metrics, and align visualizations with business objectives.


## Objectives

* Analyze daily and weekly sales performance
* Identify peak sales days and times
* Classify transactions into weekdays vs weekends
* Calculate revenue metrics and transaction volumes
* Support operational decisions such as staffing, pricing, and inventory planning

## Tools & Technologies

* **SQL** – data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
* **Google Cloud Platform**

  * Google Cloud Storage – data storage (CSV files)
  * BigQuery – querying and analysis
* **Snowflake** – cloud data warehousing and SQL analytics
* **Looker Studio** – data visualization and dashboarding
* **Miro** – project planning, data exploration, and analysis scoping


## Dataset

The dataset consists of coffee shop transactional records, including:

* Transaction date and time
* Product details
* Quantity sold
* Unit price


## Key Analysis Performed

* Date and time-based analysis (day of week, weekday vs weekend)
* Revenue calculation using quantity and unit price
* Aggregations by day, product, and transaction type
* Identification of sales patterns and trends


##Visualizations

Visualizations included in this repository are provided in **PDF format** for easy viewing and sharing. These dashboards highlight key metrics such as revenue trends, peak sales days, and product performance.
